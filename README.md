# Programmeer project UvA
I propose to build an application that is purely about food. <br>
With this app, users can view a list of popular recipes, and even add their own. <br>
If time allows it users are able to create an account and comment, add or rate recipes. <br>
I hope to inspire people to eat new things with this app, fill the gap in their stomachs.

# Features

- Database with recipes at your disposal
- Store your favorite recipes
- Create an account, comment on recipes.
- Add your own recipes
  - Upload a photo, add a description.
  - Optional: make public
  - Optional: tag a restaurant/location
 
# Sketches

# Data, Parts & API's
The main part of the application is getting and displaying a list of recipes, and has the highest priority. I'm still looking into the possibilities of a recipe API. I will need to create a database with atleast 4 tabels if I want to go online: Recipes, Users, Comments, Ratings.


# Potential problems

Building a social platform might be time consuming, I must focus on the most important features first. Connecting the different parts later might be tricky.

# Similair apps
There are a lot of food rating apps, however feature / design wise I think youTube app is a great example.

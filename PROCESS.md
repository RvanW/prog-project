# Process book

# Day 1
Think of a great app.. wrote an initial proposal. 

# Day 2
Thinking over my idea and base features. Setting up a programming environment. <br>
Researching technical difficulties, need to set up online database (for free).

# Day 3
Made some basic activities, experimenting with different types of navigation. Also looking into Parse.com for setting up database.

# Day 4
Started experimenting with Parse. Decided to go with a navigation drawer (side bar), trying to make it work smoothly. <br>
Replaced activities with fragment, app now has 1 activity which shows 1 fragment at the time.

# Day 5
Navigation bar seems to work smoothly now, added animations to fragment transitions. Started connecting to Parse.com for user login/sign up.

# Day 6
Set up proper database classes. Got login and sign up working, still need to tweak of the UI to make it show properly. Connection to Parse seems good.

# Day 7
Connect parse class to my app's java class, made a basic add recipe feature without image which gets uploaded to parse.

# Day 8
Can retrieve and show a list of recipes now from Parse, made Gallery fragment that shows all public recipes.

# Day 9
Trying to implement an upload image feature (from camera and gallery), image preview seems to disappear on screen rotation..
